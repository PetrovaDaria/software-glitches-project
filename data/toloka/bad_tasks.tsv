If you are looking for written proof for the involvement of Volkswagen’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn in the dieselgate coverup, look no further than this morning’s edition of Germany’s BILD Zeitung. Two months before the scandal became public, Volkswagen planned a highly selective disclosure strategy, the paper says in its Sunday edition. The usually well-informed mass circulation tabloid cites and shows PowerPoints from a presentation chaired by Martin Winterkorn himself.

By Farah Master

HONG KONG, Aug 31 Volkswagen AG could reach a ""final"" settlement with U.S. authorities as early as October over its large-engine diesel cars found to have cheated emissions tests in a global scandal, the sales chief of its premium Audi brand said. Dietmar Voggenreiter, head of sales and marketing worldwide for Audi, told Reuters in an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday that negotiations related to 3.0-litre engine VW and Audi cars were progressing well. ""(We're) in really good discussions with U.S. authorities,"" said Voggenreiter. ""Hopefully in October, latest the beginning of November, we will have the final agreement with the U.S.""

The worldwide scandal, dubbed ""Dieselgate"", has hurt VW's reputation and business, and already cost the German carmaker billions of dollars - not including any U.S. settlement on the large-engine diesel vehicles. The diesel emissions scandal, affecting roughly 11 million vehicles worldwide, continues to drag on VW and Audi profits, with Audi set to miss profitability targets this year and the core VW brand recording a 12 percent year-on-year drop in profit in the second quarter."

WASHINGTON, Sept 30 Volkswagen AG confirmed late Friday it will make $1.21 billion in payments to 652 U.S. brand dealers as part of its $16.5 billion diesel emissions settlement to date. VW's dealers will receive an average of $1.85 million each on average over 18 months under the settlement that was first announced in principle in August. Separately, the U.S. Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and lawyers for owners of 475,000 polluting diesel cars were filing legal papers late Friday asking a federal judge to grant final approval to buy-back offers and diesel remediation efforts at an Oct. 18 court hearing. The court documents say Volkswagen won't sell any U.S. diesel vehicles for the 2016 and 2017 model years.

By Lawrence White

LONDON, Oct 14 Britain's banks are not reporting the full extent of cyber attacks to regulators for fear of punishment or bad publicity, bank executives and providers of security systems say. Reported attacks on financial institutions in Britain have risen from just 5 in 2014 to 75 so far this year, data from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) show. However, bankers and experts in cyber-security say many more attacks are taking place. In fact, banks are under almost constant attack, Shlomo Touboul, Chief Executive of Israeli-based cyber security firm Illusive Networks said. Touboul cites the example of one large global financial institution he works with which experiences more than two billion such ""events"" a month, ranging from an employee receiving a malicious email to user or system-generated alerts of attacks or glitches."

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved."	False

It’s not just the obvious geopolitical power issues, but the massive commercial ones: Roughly half of the world’s shipping tonnage transits through that area, according to Asia's Cauldron: The South China Sea And The End Of A Stable Pacific, a fascinating book by Robert Kaplan. But the South China Sea represents only a small part of the Middle Kingdom’s maritime influence—or so contends “How China Rules The Waves,” an impressive piece of work in the Financial Times (I'm grateful to my colleague Geoff Smith for drawing my attention to it). The article, crammed with data and charts, makes a persuasive case that China has quietly become the world’s primary maritime power, far surpassing any other country.	False

FRANKFURT, Sept 26 Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser has signaled he wants to renew his contract when it runs out in 2018, a move welcomed by investors who have grown to trust the 59-year-old company veteran. Kaeser ousted his predecessor Peter Loescher in a boardroom coup in July 2013 when he was finance chief. Since then he has streamlined the German group to focus on its strengths in industrial engineering, raised profitability and seen the share price respond this year. There is still work to be done but investors believe Kaeser deserves a new contract.

It's only been about ten months since the Maserati started producing the Levante , but already the brand's debut crossover has been subjected to two recalls in the United States alone.Barely over a month ago, the Levante was included alongside the Ghibli and Quattroporte in a brand-wide recall of nearly 7,500 vehicles over a problem with their reversing cameras. Now another 1,515 examples of just the luxury crossover are being recalled due to a transmission glitch.According to the statement from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the engine software in the 2017 Levante S “may cause the transmission to shift to neutral, or the engine to shut down, when the vehicle speed is approximately two miles per hour.”The issue is distinct from FCA's earlier recall of 1.1 million examples of the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Jeep Grand Cherokee over unexpected rollaway that was linked to an unintuitive electronic shifter.This latest problem, however, was deemed to increase the risk of a crash, so Maserati is calling them in: 1,515 examples of them, to be exact. Which may not seem like a lot, until you realize that accounts for every last example the company has sold in America so far.The S model is the higher-end of the two versions of the Levante that Maserati offers in North America . It's distinguished from the base model principally by the more powerful version of the Trident brand's 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 – producing 424 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque instead of 345 hp and 369 lb-ft in standard spec.Fortunately this, like many other modern problems, is expected to be remedied by a simple software update. The campaign is already under way, but if you're one of those 1,515 owners and have yet to take yours in for the reflash, best keep an eye on the transmission position indicator and be prepared to take remedial action."

FRANKFURT, Aug 18 Sage Group, already hit by an insider data breach this week, then found itself racing to shut down security lapses by more than 20 customers after a U.S. researcher uncovered stores of their corporate data exposed online. The British financial software provider said the incidents were unrelated, but they highlight the range of security risks facing technology suppliers - from the relatively rare danger of rogue employees to the harder-to-control lax security practices of customers. Sage said the online data leaks appear to be the result of customers or contractors in more than a dozen countries ignoring warnings against installing Sage business planning software inside their firms without basic firewall protections. On Thursday it said it had spent the past two days contacting vulnerable customers to tell them to shut down connections, after being notified of the breaches by U.S. researcher Chris Vickery, 31, a security researcher for Apple utilities software maker MacKeeper.

The Predictwind routing pushes the two lead boats well to the west and north of the direct route, sailing an extra 200nm or more as a trade-off to both stay in a reasonable breeze on a favoured point of sailing. Alex Thomson probably holds most of the cards in the final play of the race which will see the winner take around 75 days to complete their solo non-stop circumnavigation. Firstly he is sufficiently far behind to be difficult to cover."	False

* Says FY revenue likely at low end of range

* Shares in Bombardier down 4.7 percent

* Lufthansa's Swiss to take fewer deliveries this year

* Bombardier reaffirms long-term production target (Adds analyst comment, updates shares)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, Sept 6 Bombardier Inc sliced in half the 2016 delivery forecast for its CSeries aircraft on Tuesday and said it expected full-year revenue to be at the lower end of its previously announced range. The setback is the latest for the CSeries program, which took years to get off the ground and has been hit by production delays and cost overruns, causing the Montreal-based plane and train maker to agree to a C$1 billion ($774 million) investment from the Quebec government. The company remained in talks with the Canadian federal government about possible funding, and some analysts said the delays could add to concerns about its financial strength. ""Bombardier has a lot of debt, limited financial flexibility and these kind of setbacks, even when they are modest and transient, can heighten concerns"", said one transport analyst who asked not to be named. Desjardins analyst Benoit Peorier said the development was ""slightly negative"" and ""unexpected."""	False

Liftoff is set for 9:54:39 a.m. PST (12:54:39 p.m. EST; 1754:39 GMT) Saturday from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base, a military launch facility located on the Pacific coastline northwest of Los Angeles. Weather forecasters at Vandenberg predict a 40 percent chance gusty winds could prevent launch Saturday. If the Falcon 9 rocket does not get off the ground Saturday, there is a backup opportunity available Sunday. The mission is vital to the futures of SpaceX and Iridium, which signed a $500 million deal in 2010 for at least seven launches to place 70 next-generation communications craft in orbit.	False

OnePlus has today started rolling out yet another software update for the OnePlus 5. The upgrade to OxygenOS 4.5.5 takes care of a handful of remaining bugs, while making improvements to areas like Wi-Fi performance, video recording, battery life and call quality — as the official changelog shows:

Optimizations:

Further improvements to Wi-Fi connectivity

Clearer voice calling

Video recording now consumes less battery

Vibration intensity when receiving calls is now tuned to a gentler level

Bug Fixes:

Fixed Wi-Fi signal consistently being displayed as weak

Fixed certain apps not able to work under IPv6 network settings

To restore connectivity to a Windows 10 PC, please turn off USB debugging prior to the upgrade

For what it's worth, there's no mention of the ""jelly scrolling"" effect that some OnePlus 5 owners are noticing, which is understood to be a hardware characteristic and won't be addressed in software. The update won't be available on all OnePlus 5 phones right away — instead, OnePlus is doing its usual staged rollout thing, where a small percentage get the update on day one, before the floodgates are opened sometime later.

To keep pace with rapid technological change

“If we’re going to scale with all the change that’s happening and have the ability to meet the increased needs of the end-user,” said Steve Daly, “we have to do something differently. We have to unify IT when it comes to end-user computing.”

BLUE BELL, Pa., July 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Unisys Corporation (NYSE: UIS) today announced it is helping the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) streamline its driver and vehicle registry platform to quickly reflect legislative changes using a new agile approach to software development. Under the new five and a half year contract, Unisys is supporting NZTA's Registry Suite – a group of systems for vehicle and driver safety programs including driver licensing, motor vehicle registration and road user charges – while moving to an innovative, cloud-based, agile DevOps delivery environment where solutions evolve based on cross-function collaboration and quick response to change. Using the agile approach, Unisys has assisted NZTA in reducing the time to implement a typical legislative change in the registry system – such as a new rule or fee – by half, from six months to three. The key factors in achieving this improvement were the use of innovative technology, including the Unisys AB Suite® application development software; adopting an agile development methodology; and physically co-locating the NZTA and Unisys development teams to promote cross-functional collaboration and fast response to changes.

The news comes only days after the Fed ruled that the house of Jamie Dimon, and the U.S.'s largest banks, now had more than enough capital to deal with any realistic risk scenarios and cleared them to return billions of dollars to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. • JP Morgan was acting as Worldpay’s corporate broker in the deal, a British designation that essentially means adviser .

This month’s edition kicks off with the big release of Riskalyze’s new Autopilot platform, which has morphed from “just” a robo-onboarding tool for a TAMP, into a full trading and rebalancing solution that operates as a “Model Marketplace” allowing advisors access to third-party managers and their models for a cost of 10 – 15bps. But the real news is that Riskalyze is also launching a series of its own proprietary “Risk Number Models”, which will be made available for “free” to advisors… because their clients using those models will then be invested at least in part into a series of new Riskalyze “smart beta” proprietary ETFs charging 0.50% to 0.77% expense ratios, as Riskalyze uses its big $20M Series A round to pivot from being “just” a FinTech solution into a proprietary ETF manufacturer that uses its technology to help distribute its own asset management products. From there, the latest highlights also include a slew of new venture capital announcements, including: Advizr financial planning software raises a whopping $7M Series A from Franklin Templeton and SEI, despite having only 400 independent advisory firms (and reporting another 500 firms via enterprise) and what is likely no more than $1M to $2M in estimated annual revenue after 2.5 years of growth (admirable growth for a start-up, but seemingly small for the amount of capital being raised… unless the company is planning a pivot?). RightCapital financial planning software raises a second $1.6M seed round, as the upstart gains momentum with 800 advisory firms, a series of new RIA enterprise deals, and positive word of mouth as it earns the top User Rating from the recent T3 Tech Hub Advisor Software survey, and also a TD Ameritrade Advisor Satisfaction Award.

Before the election the media focused on the Conservatives’ supposed “dark ads” Facebook campaign in target seats, which was often portrayed as being underhand due to its reliance on difficult-to-track unpublished adverts. Labour quietly spent £1.2 million running online adverts in the run-up to the general election, campaign sources told BuzzFeed News, using in-house software to microtarget individual voters on Facebook while also unleashing a Snapchat advertising blitz that was seen by 8 million people in one day. Conservative campaign sources separately told BuzzFeed News that they expect the total bill for their digital campaign to be in the region of £2 million across all platforms. This suggests the total online advertising spend for all parties during this election is at least £3.2 million and could rise substantially when the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens, and other parties are taken into account – underlining the extent to which spending enormous sums of money advertising on Facebook, Google, and other services is now considered to be a key part of all British political campaigns.

Whether Murdoch’s nostrum proves correct or not, China’s recent life science policy announcements suggest that the best science and strongest most innovative companies – regardless of country of origin – can thrive in China, the second largest market for medicine in the world. The outcome depends on China’s willingness to aggressively implement these emerging policy changes. Equally, success or failure for firms depends on how rapidly companies reshape their thinking, strategies and operating models to align with China’s future medical needs, scientific capabilities and policy objectives. Discovering and developing new medicines is one of the most complex human challenges.	False

Patriots are waking up to a nightmare that is only being revealed by alternative media. We are no longer able to rely on the broadcast, cable, and print media to report the news accurately, much less any mention of the heinous crimes that seem to have been committed by Washington power-brokers, global elites, world-renowned charities, the Vatican—just to name a few. For this reason, Pizzagate, the popular moniker given to the first-ever citizen OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATION of world-wide pedophilia and human trafficking, is getting huge support from citizen investigators using non-conventional media channels to reach their audiences. Maybe for the first time since the practice of slavery and sex abuse started in the days of Babylon, humanity has a way to break free from its enslavement by bringing these heinous crimes in the open without media and other powers covering up the truth. We simply cannot move forward in our spiritual development as human beings until we slay this dragon and reveal the Whore of Babylon."	False

Recently over social media, there has been controversy as the Oxford English Dictionary has defined ‘Essex Girl’ as “a type of young woman… variously characterised as unintelligent, promiscuous, and materialistic.” To add to this complementary description, just some of the example sentences of usage online include “An Essex girl goes to the council to register for child benefit”. As an ‘Essex Girl’ myself, born and bred, you can imagine my initial response. To have such an important, world-renowned publication define you in such a way for future generations is startling to say the least. However, as an English Language and Literature student, I am forced to reflect on the reasons why this definition has become recorded. The OED defines itself as a “historical dictionary” which is “very different from dictionaries of current English where the focus is on present-day meanings.” Words and phrases need to be used over a length of time in various situations to be recorded.

Two thirds of small businesses have fallen victim to cybercrime in the past two years, costing the UK economy £5.26bn, according to research from the Federation of Small Businesses. The majority of attacks are phishing and spear phishing, where cybercriminals target individuals, rather than computer systems. As cybersecurity software has become more sophisticated, small businesses’s employees have become easier targets. A common method among hackers, for example, is to pose as a company boss in an email and persuade an employee to urgently wire company money to an account.	False

Its vivosmart lineup, among others, is almost universally loved by everyone who has tried it, its brand is recognizable, hardware is capable and competitively priced, and software experience is getting better and better, making it the second largest smartwatch maker in Q3 2016 according to IDC. One of the flagships of Garmin's smartwatch line-up is the fēnix series, a watch that combines everyday activity and sleep tracking, smartwatch notifications and features, super detailed exercise tracking across different types of sports (running, swimming, cycling, hiking, golf, ski, snowboard, paddle sports, and so on), GPS logging, water resistance up to 100m, continuous heart-rate monitoring, and more. The problem of the fēnix series though so far has been its very rugged industrial design and large profile that doesn't easily fit most wrists. Enter the new fēnix 5 series of watches with three models: the 42mm fēnix 5S, the 47mm fēnix 5, and the 51mm fēnix 5X (which also comes preloaded with TOPO US maps).	False

(AP) — A massive project to modernize medical record-keeping for California prison inmates has more than doubled in cost from original estimates to nearly $400 million in just three years, the latest in a long string of computer projects that have befuddled state government. The federal court-appointed receiver who controls California’s inmate health care system approved the project in 2013 to replace the state’s antiquated paper-based records with an electronic system that can track the medical and mental health care of nearly 130,000 inmates. But a year of delays means it now won’t be installed at all 35 prisons until the end of 2017, and inmate advocates are so concerned that they may seek to push it back even longer at some troubled prisons. The cost ballooned from the original $182 million projection to $386.5 million now in part because the first estimate left out basics like the cost of maintaining the system and replacing worn-out equipment, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press. The receiver, J. Clark Kelso, said his office also failed to anticipate needing $13 million worth of mobile devices — 16,800 laptops, dictation machines and other gear.	False

I am a co-founder of a start-up that helps companies with their efforts to hire more women. In the fall, in meetings with potential clients in the San Francisco Bay Area, I became aware of a dangerous trend: Employers are turning to techniques that “mask” the gender of the candidates they interview — removing names from résumés and altering voices on phone calls, for example — with the hope that this will offer a quick fix to diversity failures. These gender-masking tools and the related trend of “blind hiring” have recently been chronicled in The New York Times and Wired, and discussed at tech conferences. One head of talent at a major financial services company told me she’s getting up to five pitches a week for tools that can mask applicants’ gender. My team is regularly told by potential clients in the Fortune 100 that they are already using tools to obscure gender in hiring."	False

Beath’s off-the-cuff observation, which he made in response to a Fortune query about the security of bitcoin, is amusing. But it also underscores a serious problem: Namely, a new era of computing is fast-approaching and when it arrives, the system that gave rise to many crypto-currency fortunes will collapse.

By Kanishka Singh and Douglas Busvine

FRANKFURT/BENGALURU, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Security issues with Intel Corp microchips are only slowing computers slightly, technology companies said, as researchers played down the need for mass hardware replacements to protect millions of devices from hackers. Google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws - one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. That raised the prospect of Intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, driving the company’s shares down. But Intel said in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed on Thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time. It said Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches."	False

A new study published in the scientific trade journal Neuropharmacology has revealed that organic compounds found in certain mushrooms can be used to treat depression by opening disused neurological pathways in the brain. Many current methods of treating psychological depression — particularly those involving highly-expensive ‘designer' molecules and laboratory-constructed pharmaceuticals — have been shown to be ‘treatment-resistant,' according to reports. The controlled use of plant materials that are without the well-known side-effects of many prescription drugs is seen as a major step forward in the emotional well-being of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) victims and other sufferers of depression, according to Psypost.org.

(Reuters) - Chances that a fix to a major microchip security flaw may slow down or crash some computer systems are leading some businesses to hold off installing software patches, fearing the cure may be worse than the original problem.

Like all other browsers, Brave includes a ""private browsing"" option that leaves no traces of online activity on your computer and makes websites think you've never visited before. But the startup is working on adding a new level of protection to its private tabs by incorporating the Tor Project's network identity-hiding technology. Yan Zhu, a Brave programmer whose long history of privacy and security projects includes encrypted email at Yahoo and some work on Tor's software, is leading Brave's Tor work.

The military offensive in Raqqa has been a source of contention between the United States and Turkey since the two NATO allies do not see eye to eye on the exact composition of the force deployed to free Daesh's last major urban stronghold. Washington has indicated that the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will lead the campaign to encircle and recapture the capital of Daesh's caliphate. Although Ankara is fiercely opposed to this since it views the Kurds as a destabilizing force in the region and at home, its ability to do something about it is limited, but not entirely non-existent. This is what could have to an extent prompted the Pentagon to set up an air base near Kobani, a Kurdish-controlled city located approximately 90 miles away from Raqqa, last year.

HONG KONG (CNNMoney) — Australia’s consumer watchdog is taking Apple to court. The regulator is accusing the U.S. tech giant of violating consumers’ rights by refusing to service certain iPhones and iPads that were disabled by a software update. Some iPad and iPhone users who used third parties to fix broken screens later received an error message after downloading an Apple software update, rendering their devices unusable, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Through the software update, Apple effectively “bricked” devices repaired by third parties and then “refused to look at or service” them, the commission said, calling it a breach of Australian consumer law. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."	False

In honor of the 100th anniversary of the U.S. joining World War I on April 6, 1917, a new TIME special edition looks back on the impact of that conflict — including its role in creating one of the most iconic posters in American history. World War I produced one of the most memorable images in American history: the U.S. Army recruiting poster that depicts a commanding Uncle Sam pointing his finger at the viewer and urging young men to enlist in the war effort. Painted by noted U.S. illustrator James Montgomery Flagg, the image first appeared on the cover of the July 6, 1916, issue of Leslie’s Weekly magazine with the title “What Are You Doing for Preparedness?” The U.S. would not declare war on Germany until April of the next year, but the storm signals were clear. The image was later adapted by the U.S. Army for the poster with the new, unforgettable call to action."	False

Kaye reports, “As well as fines, the ACCC said it was seeking injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs.”

“The first thing that struck me was the Apple executives who were and weren’t present at the meeting. Present were Phil Schiller (SVP worldwide marketing), Craig Federighi (SVP software engineering), John Ternus (VP hardware engineering), and Bill Evans (Sr. Director Corporate Communications),” Kingsley-Hughes writes. “Not present were CEO Tim Cook and Chief Design Officer Jony Ive.”

Kingsley-Hughes writes, “Ive’s absence is interesting given Federighi’s claim that Apple ‘designed ourselves into a bit of a corner’ with the Mac Pro, and suggests that Ive had nothing to do with the Mac Pro and didn’t want to be caught up in any toxic fallout from that blunder.”

In the most recent quarter, Apple said it was holding $246 billion in cash, of which $230 billion was held in foreign subsidiaries. '”

Lovejoy writes, “The combination of the two would have a significant impact on earnings per share, says Citi… ‘Our analysis show a reduction in US tax rate will drive 6% benefit to EPS while a cash repatriation holiday and share buyback could drive an incremental 10% EPS benefit (assuming 25% of repatriated cash used for stock buy back).

Gruber writes that his sources believe inductive—that is, sans wires—charging for the next iPhone will arrive later than the device's launch and with its own price tag. I’ve heard that inductive charging will (a) be sold separately, and (b) might be late, waiting for iOS 11.1 (a la Portrait mode last year).	False

Yet despite its staggering growth – up 500 per cent in the past five years alone – bitcoin is likely to be eclipsed by an upstart called Ethereum that was developed by a twentysomething Torontonian.

Contributing Writer

Baseball struggled to get momentum going this weekend in their series against the Rams of Rhode Island University at Bill Feck Field. Game 1

The Rams competed in a three-game series against the URI Rams, but couldn’t get going offensively during the “Battle of the Rams opener,” ultimately concluding the game with a 5-1 loss. URI got things started in the bottom of the first inning, when Martin Figueroa doubled two batters in, followed by a single by Jordan Powell to give URI a 1-0 lead. A home run from Mike Corin in the bottom of the second inning gave the home team a 2-0 advantage. At the bottom of the third inning, Rhode Island hit a two RBI single to centerfield raising the score to 4-0."	False

I’ve rarely gotten as many responses to an article as I did to last week’s post on the Kotel (Western Wall) compromise. Yet most of them interpreted what I considered a simple statement of fact—that American Jews have less influence over Israeli decisions when Israelis perceive them as turning away from Israel—as an expression of personal opposition to the compromise and/or justification for its cancellation. So to eliminate any confusion between my opinion and the aforementioned fact, which I consider vital for American Jews to understand, I’ll devote this post to my opinion. Advertisement

I supported the compromise, though as an Orthodox Jew, my reasons were different from those of most American Jews. Nevertheless, I feel the government’s decision to scrap the deal was defensible, but not for any reason involving American Jewish attitudes toward Israel."	False

For years, investors in South Korea have become accustomed to belligerence and regular missile tests from the country's hostile northern neighbor, but now there's a new factor in their regional risk assessments — U.S. President Donald Trump . Jolts to financial markets from North Korea's military provocations are frequent but were until recently contained by an implicit expectation that global diplomatic efforts could limit Pyongyang's aggression.

A program on media company WDR, Aktuelle Stunde, noted a profile of Amri indicating that he was in contact with people tied to Daesh while in North Rhine-Westphalia. The suspect first drew suspicion in Berlin for having close contact with people connected to the “Salafist-Islamist scene.” While in Germany Amri visited 15 mosques, 12 of which were located in the western Ruhr region. Authorities also believe the dead attacker may have been linked with Germany-based Salafist minister Ahmad Abdulaziz Abdullah A., also known as Abu Walaa, who has been labeled a ""hate preacher"" by German police.

Kissinger, now 93, defused decades of potentially war-threatening confrontation between Washington and Moscow at the height of the Cold War, and remains a figure of enormous influence in the United States, Petro pointed out. ""Kissinger is a legendary figure, so his support for Trump’s foreign policy and for Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state is quite important,"" Petro said. Kissinger, even at his advanced age, was not an isolated figure, but worked closely with other powerful and influential Americans who wanted to restore good diplomatic, strategic and business ties with Russia, Petro added.

The loss of brightness by Boyaijan's star is far too drastic to be explained by an orbiting planet blocking our view of it, and the discovery has sparked a furor among researchers to discover what the cause of the dimming is. Hypotheses include comet fragments, a cloud of some sort of interstellar matter (the preferred hypothesis of the scientific community, according to Pennsylvania State University's Jason Wright) or simply a variance in the star's luminosity. The most outlandish, and yet intriguing, hypothesis is the possibility of an alien megastructure. Breakthrough Listen, a $100-million initiative to discover extraterrestrial life sponsored by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, has led the charge in investigating the potential of alien life around Boyaijan's star.

(PALM BEACH, Fla.) — Donald Trump on Wednesday touted plans by a Japanese mogul to bring 8,000 jobs to the United States. They could be the first of the 50,000 jobs tech billionaire Masayoshi Son promised to create after meeting with the president-elect earlier in December. In the grand scheme of the economy, the jobs announcement is unlikely to have a major impact. Still, it’s another example of how Trump is trying to stoke voters’ belief that he is actively fighting for their well-being. The announcement came during a whirlwind day in which Trump accused President Barack Obama of throwing up “inflammatory” roadblocks during the transition of power and said his administration was treating Israel with “total disdain.”

So when the time comes you’ll want to be prepared and spend plenty of time auditioning speakers as you’ll likely live with them for a while. One typically bases their buying decision on a number of parameters such as how well the speakers perform, how much they cost, their physical size, aesthetics and specifications. Speaker specifications are typically noted right on the speakers or in the accompanying product literature. What has always surprised me is how many people base their loudspeaker buying decision largely on specifications, in particular the “frequency response”, yet they really don’t have an understanding of what the specifications actually mean.

For decades, Mugabe and the war veterans — the force behind the strongman’s continued hold on power since 1980 — had been involved in a love-and-hate relationship before it reached a thawing moment in 2016. First, it was Mugabe’s admission that he was responsible for the deployment of the police that torched the once untouchable veterans of the 1970s liberation struggle in February this year for participating in an illegal gathering. He blasted Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans’ Association (ZNLWVA) chairman, then War Veterans minister Christopher Mutsvangwa, for abusing his government position to organise a meeting of the former combatants under the guise that the President wanted to address them.

The Mercedes engine’s infamous ‘party mode’ that delivered Hamilton a blistering pole lap on Saturday could do little once Ferrari’s Vettel nosed ahead when re-entering from pit-lane midway through the race at Albert Park. Pole-sitter Hamilton had appeared set to coast to victory with a clear pace advantage but the race turned on its head with the safety car, which was called after Romain Grosjean’s Haas failed and rolled to a stop at turn two. In another bonus for Ferrari, Kimi Raikkonen finished third, fending off Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and leaving the unlucky Australian still searching for a first podium in his home race. Four-times world champion Vettel claimed a 48th overall win and his third in Melbourne following his victories at Albert Park last year and in 2011.	False

Microglia and astrocytes are not only the main immune cells of the central nervous system, but are also closely related to the formation of scar tissue after nerve injury. 3 Glial scarring begins to form after TBI and forms basically at 3 days, and becomes more obvious at 7 days. 4 5 The scar formation has two effects on brain injury: (1) the formation of scar tissue around the lesions separates the inflammatory necrotic tissue from normal tissue in the early injury stage, preventing the inflammation from spreading; and (2) sustained scarring interferes with the growth of neuron axons in the later stage, which curbs the neuronal repair. 6 Our previous studies have found that acupuncture can regulate scar repair and promote the regeneration of neurons.

And we suspect it will only get worse as developers add more and more to their games in order to satisfy the new generation gamers and their raised expectations. Even bought disc games require installation onto the drive before being played, so you'll find the storage that comes with the PS4 to be woefully inadequate if you're a heavy consumer of titles. And considering the prices of some in the recent sales, it needn't even cost the Earth to accrue a healthy collection. Yes, Sony introduced its own 1TB version last year, but what if you can't afford it or have an older model?	False

Recognizing a property with binge potential and name recognition, Netflix has obliged, punching up a six-episode final season that reunites the central characters and picks up pretty much where they left off — with baggage that spills over into, and largely eclipses, a new, fairly uninspired case. Despite flashes of what initially made the Danish adaptation so intriguing, this stretch drive can’t escape the feeling of a show ready to be put out of its misery. The dense mood and mystery won the skein a rabid following, only to squander much of that goodwill when the first season didn’t wrap up the opening investigation. The second arc dragged, and a third — under a shared arrangement with Netflix — embarked on a new story that was engaging only about half the time.	False

British scientists have come up with a new strategy in their quest to find life on Mars - a robot armed with a selfie stick with a mirror on it. Prototype, pictured

The wheeled robot (early version, above) carrying the space selfie stick is called the ExoMars rover and will be sent on a mission to the Red Planet when it blasts off in 2020

The project is led by the European Space Agency (ESA) but the selfie mirror is designed and developed by a team of scientists at Aberystwyth University

The robot rover is the first to be fitted with a 'selfie mirror' allowing it to take pictures of itself on Mars to beam them back to Earth."	False

Although it is a puzzle as to how they function in general, we can theorize as to how they act in the affected area in which they are introduced, whether it be the spine, knee, hip, or peripheral nerves. These cells are small seedlings found in our body since birth and are responsible for our growth (during our youth and adolescence) until we reach our “pinnacle period” between 30 and 35 years old. Unfortunately, (as we are not immortal) stem cells will begin to grow scarcer over the years, which we now understand is the process of aging. We have been actively working with autologous adult stem cells for 12 years, and the results are truly impressive, with more than 80 percent of patients reporting substantial improvement, usually around nine weeks after implantation.

Yet they often walk away from the experience empty-handed. The reason, he says: there are fewer than 100,000 commercial owned vehicles available from traditional rental services. Cavins says that his San Francisco-based company, Outdoorsy, is beginning to address this issue by enabling owners of the 14 million privately owned RVs in the United States to rent them to users, à la Airbnb. The vehicles are mostly sitting around collecting dust anyway, says Cavins, who cofounded the company in late 2014 after heading up seven previous companies — two of which were publicly traded.	False

The detailed discussions, held between various Ministry of Defence (MoD) agencies and the Civil Aviation Authority, took place to enable the flying of Predator drones in UK airspace. While the military initially hoped they could fly their Predators (quaintly renamed “Protector” in 2016) everywhere, discussion with the CAA led to their ambitions being scaled back. Unmanned aircraft technology is posing an increasing challenge for regulators as the hype and excitement of the tech world meets the hard and unforgiving laws of aviation – and of physics.

“eMagin Corporation, or the “Company,” (NYSE American:EMAN) a leader in the development, design and manufacture of Active Matrix OLED microdisplays for high resolution imaging products, today is providing clarification in response to a media report in which the author apparently misconstrued a form underwriting agreement that the Company filed as an exhibit to its S-1 on January 23, 2018 and incorrectly stated that a group of certain consumer electronics companies participated in the recent offering of the Company that closed on January 29,2018. As of today, to the Company’s knowledge, none of these consumer electronics companies have taken part in the offering.”

The notice of the three companies, along with two others, investing in a round for the company appeared in an SEC filing for a fundraising that the company advertised, under a list entitled, “Specified Investors”. As we pointed out in our original report, below, the filing from the end of January was tipped to us by the blog Road to VR. The news sent the stock for this relatively modest company soaring over 17 percent, adding nearly $10 million to its market cap, ending at $59 million.

Rupert Murdoch reportedly confronted Mark Zuckerberg in front of witnesses in 2016, demanding Facebook adjust its business model to be a better partner to the publishing industry. The conversation seemed to spur some action at Facebook, though not enough, and Facebook is expected to make a number of updates to its news feed throughout 2018. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has heard from a lot of frustrated news organizations and leaders in media about the role Facebook has played in spreading fake news — and some of the strongest words reportedly came directly from Robert Murdoch, the media mogul and founder of News Corp, according to a Wired report by Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstei. Shortly after Facebook's Vice President of Product Management Adam Mosseri published Building a Better News Feed for You — an explainer about how the platform would try to prioritize posts from friends and family in users' news feeds moving forward — Murdoch and News Corp CEO Robert Thomson reportedly confronted Zuckerberg at an annual conference in Sun Valley in a room with others present.

For the three months ending 31 December, Microsoft posted a 201 percent decline after revealing a net loss of $6.3 billion (£4.4bn) compared to a net profit of $6.3bn (£4.4bn) in the same year-ago period. However this was mostly down to the fact that Redmond took a very stiff $13.8bn (£9.7bn) one-time charge due to the new US tax law.

We like things neat and we like horizons straight. That’s great for landscapes and products, but when you photograph groups of people you need to rein in your symmetry bug and set things a little off-kilter. If you line up faces side by side with eyes and mouths at the same level it looks static and the people don’t look cozy or comfortable. Sometimes you can solve this simply by tilting the camera a little bit, which will misalign their eyes and mouths and it gives the image more energy.	False

The bone volume over total tissue volume (BV/TV) in the posterior calcaneal tuberosity (PCT), the site of Achilles tendon attachment to calcaneus, was decreased in SMTS mice compared with the sham group, as determined by 3D μCT analysis 2 weeks after surgery, but restored 8 weeks after SMTS (Figure 1, A and B). The trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) were decreased 4 weeks after SMTS.	False

A counter argument: Perhaps tourism to Slovenia has risen because it has a lot of great things to offer. The red roofs of old town Ljubljana, the serene beauty of Lake Bled, the glass funicular that travels up to Ljubljana Castle, the underground beauty of Postojna Cave, indulgent Soviet-era spas, and a thriving music scene that comes out to play at the annual MENT festival are just a few reasons to visit.

In order to assess whether IDH and JAK2 mutations cooperate to transform hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we crossed mice with conditional IDH1R132H or Idh2R140Q alleles (encoding human IDH1 and murine Idh2 mutations, respectively) with mice with a previously described Jak2V617F (13) allele, and then used the inducible Mx1-Cre (27) allele to induce expression of these alleles in hematopoietic cells. Expression of IDH1R132H or Idh2R140Q in concert with Jak2V617F resulted in a fully penetrant, lethal disease. In timed sacrifices at approximately 6 months of age, mice with combined mutations of IDH1R132H or Idh2R140Q and Jak2V617F showed polycythemia (mean hematocrit levels of 59% and 65%, respectively), leukocytosis (mean leukocyte counts of 23.78 K/μl and 16.22 K/μl, respectively; 1, A and E), and splenomegaly (spleen weights of 574.4 mg and 690.7 mg, respectively; Figure 1, B and F), which was similar to what we observed in the Jak2-mutant controls. IDH1R132H and Idh2R140Q mice had elevated serum levels of 2HG (Figure 1, C and G), and 2HG levels were higher in mice with concurrent IDH1R132H and Jak2V617F mutations compared with mice with the IDH1R132H mutation alone (P = 0.0024), suggesting that Jak2 and IDH1 mutations interact to promote higher 2HG levels (interaction P = 0.0375; Figure 1C) through either increased 2HG production or higher IDH-mutant cell burden.

This provides a mechanistic insight into a previously enigmatic neuropsychiatric phenotype and expands our view on the role of white matter integrity in cognitive and executive functions in general. Importantly, we have discovered a potential therapy by targeting microglial cells, which emerge as mediators of this neuropsychiatric syndrome. Our study was based on the previously reported “catatonia-depression” phenotype of aged mice heterozygous for Cnp (11), which led us to a translational approach from mice to humans and back. Studying the deeply phenotyped GRAS sample of schizophrenic patients (37, 38), we first demonstrated an age-dependent, unexpectedly high prevalence of more than 25% of catatonic signs, exceeding by far the current estimates of approximately 0.2%–3.0% catatonia in schizophrenic subjects (5).

Immunofluorescence analyses of tissue sections cut from human lung samples revealed an abundance of CD3+ T cells, some of which congregated into dense clusters (Figure 1A). To gain insight into the frequency of CD8+ T cells that could be resident within the lung tissue, we assessed these cells for the expression of CD69, a negative regulator of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1R), and the integrin CD103, as expression of these markers distinguishes tissue resident memory T cells from circulating memory T cell subsets (12). The intrapulmonary memory T cell (CD45RO+CD3+) compartment could be divided into 3 subsets based on the expression of CD103 and CD69.	False

Dark clouds loom over Tezos in California courts (Keystone)

A fourth class-action Tezos lawsuit filed in the United States has called on Californian courts to freeze an estimated $1 billion (CHF990 million) of investor assets sitting in a Swiss-based foundation. Law firm Block & Leviton argues that the recent departure of a Tezos Foundation director and the apparent replacement of the entity’s auditor gives weight to its demand for funds, derived from an initial public offering (ICO) in July, to be frozen. “The situation regarding the ICO proceeds has deteriorated further, making irreparable looting an imminent prospect,” court filings claim. “Without immediate judicial intervention, Defendants may completely consume the illegally obtained ICO proceeds, leaving Plaintiff and the Class with no remedy.”

The filings argue that California courts would have the jurisdictional power to freeze assets held by the Swiss-based foundation because the ICO fundraiser was “governed By Federal and California law”. Along with the injunction demanding that assets are frozen, Block & Leviton has filed a class action lawsuit, alleging the ICO represented an “unqualified and unregistered” sale of “securities”."

Amid the raging #Metoo scandal, in which tens of thousands of women across the globe have protested sexual harassment, a Norwegian researcher has come up with a surprising and, possibly, unpopular approach: men and women are equally vulnerable to sexual harassment at work.The Norwegian Institute of Occupational Health ( Stami ) concluded in an earlier cross-industry survey that both sexes are exposed to harassment in the workplace.the Norwegian Institute of Occupational Health wrote.According to the Bergen Bullying Research Group , men and woman are on par in reporting harassment, although more women than men describe themselves as targets and victims.Nils Lavik, a civil economist at Lund University and a recruitment consultant, attributed this disparity not to the sexual offense as such, but how men and women individually perceive and interpret them. As men are in most cases physically superior, it is therefore reasonable to assume that women feel more ""attacked"" by their harassers.

Facebook is projected to boost sales by 46 percent and double net income, but make no mistake: It had a terrible year. Despite its financial performance, the social media giant is facing a reckoning in 2018 as regulators close in on several fronts.The main issue cuts to the core of the company itself: Rather than ""building global community,"" as founder Mark Zuckerberg sees Facebook's mission,Those are the words of Chamath Palihapitiya, the company's former vice president of user growth. He doesn't allow his kids to use Facebook because he doesn't want them to become slaves toPalihapitya's criticism echoes that of Facebook's first president, Sean Parker Facebook has reacted nervously to Palihapitya's accusations, saying he hadn't worked at the company for a long time (he left in 2011) and wasn't aware of Facebook's recent initiatives.To outsiders and regulators, Facebook looks like a dangerous provider of instant gratification in a space suddenly vital to the health of society. It's also making abuse and aggression too easy -- something the U.K. Committee on Standards in Public Life pointed out in a report published on Wednesday. Sounding one of the loudest alarm bells on social media yet, the panel urged the prime minister to back legislation to ""shift the balance of liability for illegal content to the social media companies."

This article originally appeared on the Strategist. The one item you can find on the wish lists of 8-year-old boys, teenage boys, college students, and gamers alike this holiday season is a virtual-reality headset—and one of this year’s most popular and requested VR headsets is the HTC Vive. That’s for good reason. As Austin Evans, a tech reviewer with over 2.6 million followers on his eponymous YouTube channel, explains, “If you’re just straight-up going for ‘I want the best VR headset that money can buy,’ I would say the Vive is the way to go.” But the HTC Vive, and its closest competitor, the Oculus Rift, are both quite expensive ($599 and $399, respectively, and that doesn’t include the cost of the high-powered gaming PC required to run either system).

Since SolarCity/Tesla was the biggest player in the residential solar market, the fall in their sales means the whole industry took a hit–especially because SolarCity’s now-defunct door-to-door sales tactics were a major way many people found out about solar home technology in the first place, as the sales practice also doubled as an awareness campaign into the tech.MG	False

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be introducing an Ultra Low Emission Zone in April 2019 but 65 years ago this month the city was hit by the worst air pollution catastrophe in history. The Great Smog of 1952, which claimed 12,000 lives, was caused by an anti-cyclone weather system which hung over the city for four days and exacerbates the already terrible air pollution, which was caused by high consumption of coal. Kate Winkler Dawson, a journalism professor at the University of Texas in Austin and author of Death In The Air, spent months trawling through archives and old newspaper cuttings and discovered the disaster was overshadowed by a more sensational story.

From tax reform to healthcare, the ruling Republican party has been unable to convince any Democrats that their initiatives have merit.

President Trump-appointed Chairman Ajit Pai was joined in the repeal vote by another Trump appointee, Brendan Carr, and Michael O'Rielly — initially appointed by President Obama, but a long-time Republican policy adviser."

Before information about the direct contact was leaked, the only known diplomatic connection was maintained by the State Department through the United Nations. The information comes hot on the heels after former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who is reported to favor so-called “quiet diplomacy,” stepped in as the Secretary of State. Former head of the State Department Rex Tillerson was fired by Donald Trump, with whom he reportedly disagreed on some issues, including Tillerson’s choice of diplomatic engagement over other tactics.

As data centers are called upon to handle an explosion of unstructured data fed into a variety of cutting-edge applications, the future for FPGAs looks bright. That’s because FPGAs, or field programmable gate arrays, are essentially chips that can be programmed, after manufacturing, to act as custom accelerators for workloads including machine-learning, complex data analysis, video encoding, and genomics – applications that have far-reaching consequences for communications, networking, health care, the entertainment industry and many other businesses. Such applications lend themselves to parallel processing, an important feature of FPGAs, which can also be reconfigured on the fly to handle new features as the nature of these workloads evolve. Now Xilinx, which for decades has vied with rival Altera (now part of Intel) for technical leadership in FPGAs, is unveling what it calls a new product category – the Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) – that, it says, goes far beyond the capabilities of current FPGAs.

That’s because FPGAs, or field programmable gate arrays, are essentially chips that can be programmed, after manufacturing, to act as custom accelerators for workloads including machine-learning, complex data analysis, video encoding, and genomics – applications that have far-reaching consequences for communications, networking, health care, the entertainment industry and many other businesses. Such applications lend themselves to parallel processing, an important feature of FPGAs, which can also be reconfigured on the fly to handle new features as the nature of these workloads evolve. Now Xilinx, which for decades has vied with rival Altera (now part of Intel) for technical leadership in FPGAs, is unveling what it calls a new product category – the Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) – that, it says, goes far beyond the capabilities of current FPGAs.

The Role: The relatively new label of social-media influencer doesn't have a precise definition, and can be measured in a number of ways.

Further muddying the definition is the fact that social-media influencers come in many different forms and speak to many different audiences: from fashion bloggers and makeup artists to travel writers, professional athletes, industry insiders, singers, chefs, connoisseurs, entrepreneurs, models, photographers and just about anyone else who has the attention of one or more audience groups via social media.

Auditor Michael Ferguson even went so far as to warn that the government may be “in a similar situation” to Australia, where a comparable problem has already cost more than $1.2 billion over the last eight years and still isn’t completely fixed. Ferguson’s review of the disastrous Phoenix pay system detailed just how many and how often public servants are either being overpaid and underpaid, how badly federal officials gauged the size and the scope of the problem, and how the government under-reported the number of outstanding pay problems even as issues grew. In all, there were 150,000 employees with pay problems that needed correcting at the start of summer, and a value of over $520 million worth of mistakes. The Liberals will provide a full and detailed cost estimate to fix the system, but not until next May, with plans to finalize by next month a preliminary road map of dozens of projects aimed at fixing Phoenix.

A huge cult hit in 1998 at the Jane Street Theatre, it ran for two years and nabbed a slew of awards. The soundtrack was a bestseller, with Rolling Stone magazine crowing that “Hedwig” was “the first undeniably kick-ass rock musical.”

For the uninitiated, the exuberant musical traces the saga of a neglected “slip of a girlyboy” from communist East Berlin who had a botched sex-change operation before escaping to America and ending up in New York, in search of true love. Hedwig suffers from a series of bad choices and dashed dreams, namely, the failure to become a mega rocker like her ex-boyfriend, Tommy, who shot to stardom by ripping off her songs."	False

What's the best way to host your company's data?	Sharing data means securing data and figuring out how best to secure your data while making it accessible everywhere is a challenge faced by every business. But if you're a small business owner, how you choose may make the difference between spending all day managing your data rather than managing your business. And how and where your data should be housed is one of the most important decisions you'll need to make. Traditionally, file sharing meant storing files on a server that lives within the four walls of your business, which you have complete control over, and you used your local network for people to access those files. But with the proliferation of high speed internet, businesses willing to let you work from wherever you are, and a ton of cloud services available, you may not need to own your own server to make your data available to your users.

One of the most important appointments a prime minister can make is to the Supreme Court, the ultimate arbiter of Canada's laws. And with Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin stepping down next month, Justin Trudeau has a chance to shape the court in two ways: first, by choosing a new justice to join the bench; and second, by choosing which of the current eight puisne judges will be elevated to chief. The only requirements for Supreme Court justices are that three of nine come from Quebec, and that they have served either on the bench of a superior court or for 10 years at the bar. The rest is convention, though the conventions are powerful: When Mr. Trudeau last year considered leaving the top court without an Atlantic representative, the legal community howled and the Prime Minister appointed Malcolm Rowe of Newfoundland and Labrador.

In picking a new justice, Mr. Trudeau will almost certainly follow regional convention by choosing another jurist from British Columbia to replace Chief Justice McLachlin, who has served in that role since 1989."	False

One of the most important appointments a prime minister can make is to the Supreme Court, the ultimate arbiter of Canada's laws. And with Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin stepping down next month, Justin Trudeau has a chance to shape the court in two ways: first, by choosing a new justice to join the bench; and second, by choosing which of the current eight puisne judges will be elevated to chief. The only requirements for Supreme Court justices are that three of nine come from Quebec, and that they have served either on the bench of a superior court or for 10 years at the bar. The rest is convention, though the conventions are powerful: When Mr. Trudeau last year considered leaving the top court without an Atlantic representative, the legal community howled and the Prime Minister appointed Malcolm Rowe of Newfoundland and Labrador. Story continues below advertisement

In picking a new justice, Mr. Trudeau will almost certainly follow regional convention by choosing another jurist from British Columbia to replace Chief Justice McLachlin, who has served in that role since 1989."	False

The proposal, led by FCC chairman Ajit Pai reignites the conversation and argument surrounding free speech and internet control, and brings a potential round of fights between media and tech giants; namely between AT&T and Google. “Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Mr. Pai, a Republican, said in a released statement. “Instead, the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that's best for them and entrepreneurs and other small business can have the technical information they need to innovate.”

On Wednesday, analyst Kanwaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi of Kotak Institutional Equities Research said in a note that the bill was “even more draconian than our initial view as it seeks to strengthen the non-displacement clause and makes it mandatory for all applications for H-1B dependent employers and increase investigations.

The Role: The relatively new label of social-media influencer doesn't have a precise definition, and can be measured in a number of ways.

Further muddying the definition is the fact that social-media influencers come in many different forms and speak to many different audiences: from fashion bloggers and makeup artists to travel writers, professional athletes, industry insiders, singers, chefs, connoisseurs, entrepreneurs, models, photographers and just about anyone else who has the attention of one or more audience groups via social media.

In late November, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he had reached a deal with Carrier to keep about 800 manufacturing jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico.

The poll conducted in December 2016 revealed that 65 percent of respondents believed they lived in a developed country and about a third (32 percent) thought the economic situation in Russia would get better in 2017, while 40 percent of the respondents believed that the social inequality would grow and 25 percent said Russia was an underdeveloped country. The Russian economy suffered a setback in 2014, as the ruble lost about half of its value against the US dollar amid low global oil prices and Western economic sanctions imposed against Russia over the Ukrainian crisis. According to the Russian Economic Development Ministry, the economy started slowly to recover in the wake of improvement of oil prices expectations, after OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to reduce oil extraction volumes.

By Mia Shanley and Eric Auchard

HELSINKI/FRANKFURT, Nov 30 Europe's tech sector is on track for a record level of investments this year but poor access to late-stage capital is keeping it from creating independent tech ""gorillas"", one of the region's most active investors said. Europe is expected to hit $13.6 billion in tech investments in 2016, up from $12.6 billion in 2015 and almost five times levels five years ago, venture capital firm Atomico said in a report released at Slush, one of the region's biggest tech start-up conferences. New hives of activity are popping up outside the main tech hubs in places like Munich, Zurich, Copenhagen and Lisbon with money flowing into industries ranging from music and fintech to fashion and food. Long the laggard in terms of risk-taking, access to capital and creation of globally successful companies relative to Silicon Valley, Europe's rising tech scene is starting to stand out in some unexpected ways. Five of the world's top ten technical universities are located in the region and Europe also appears to have an edge over the United States in software development."	False

Will the first foreign law firm to set up in India be coming to Gujarat?

LiveLaw called it a “baby step towards opening India’s legal and accounting sector to foreign players”, and indeed, the amendment is a small one, deleting just five words - “excluding legal services and accounting” - from Rule 76 of The Special Economic Zones Rules, 2006, which specifies some of the businesses that are allowed to set up in such zones. In effect, this would allow domestic law firms and possibly legal process outsourcers (LPOs) to set up shop inside SEZs, and could be evidence of how the government will eventually intend to open up the legal market."

Vivo's 2016 flagship, the XPlay 5, was an absolute beast of a phone when it hit the market last March. It was the world's first phone with 6GB of RAM (preceding the OnePlus 3 by a couple of months), and rocked a then-very new Snapdragon 820. So with that in mind, Vivo's follow-up, the just released XPlay 6, may lack some of that initial wow factor at first glance, since it contains mostly the same specs, including the aforementioned RAM and processor. But I've spent the past week using the Vivo XPlay 6 as my daily driver, and I can say the XPlay 6 is a major improvement over the last phone. Yes, nothing about the XPlay 6 pops off the stat-sheet (unless you count the almost silly 16-megapixel selfie cam) or differ from the last phone, but this is a much more refined piece of premium, beautiful hardware without any significant flaw."

During the hour-long discussion with Rao this morning, students spoke about their frustrations with not having enough black counselors, mental health resources or faculty to facilitate their learning at VCU.

These demands included topics regarding cultural competency training for all students and faculty, increased hiring of black faculty and staff, more funding for black centered multicultural programming and a need for safe spaces for black students on campus.

Contributing Writer

With the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death rapidly approaches, The Quill Theatre is commemorating the incomparably-influential playwright with a bold production of one of his many gritty works. Their current production of “King Lear” directed by Jan Powell at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts stars Joe Inscoe as the title character. With ticket prices ranged from $20-35, the show will run until April 23. “King Lear” details the story of the king by which the show is titled, and how how he is resigns from his noble position and divides his land between his three daughters. The show touches on some key themes of justice, obliviousness and the importance but faults with order opposed to chaos."	False

Because the router directs traffic to my devices, it’s basically a “blanket” solution that results in just the router being connected, while all your connected devices are automatically routed through the VPN.

The investigation follows an announcement Thursday by the EPA that FCA failed to disclose eight separate software routines that affect the engine's emissions.

For companies that need to add compressed air piping for an expansion or new production equipment, designing the piping structure is critical to overall system efficiency and reliability. While most designers look at variable-speed drive (VSD) compressors or controls to enhance system efficiency, piping remains an important contributor to system optimization. Piping makeovers can contribute greatly to total system efficiency. There are four things to consider in examining how piping affects system efficiency:

Pipe diameter – Pipes that are too small cause a high pressure drop. If systems lose pressure, businesses lose money because they need to produce more air to overcome the pressure differential."	False

Thanks to Facebook’s treasure trove of user data, advertisers on its site have been able to narrowly target users by a variety of factors, like age, location, gender, religion, and more. These microtargeting capabilities have been used for years in a number of ways, including, most recently in the U.S. presidential election to reach niche audiences with political ads customized to their own interests.

If you weren’t already aware, a lot of the ‘education’ of self-driving vehicle software happens in virtual environments, since it’s still relatively expensive to build an actual self-driving test vehicle, and a bit complicated on the regulatory side to find somewhere willing to let you test in real-world conditions – plus you have to prove you can do so with a reasonable expectation of safety. That’s a steep hurdle for tinkerers working independently, and for companies just starting out. Udacity committed to building an open source autonomous car as part of its effort to offer its self-driving car nanodegree program, which will use code written by hundreds of its students from around the world (which will be available publicly via open source license).

Today, the social network provided a progress update on the matter, disclosing what actions it has taken since its announcement was first made, along with details of its new advertising policies and related tools. Thanks to Facebook’s treasure trove of user data, advertisers on its site have been able to narrowly target users by a variety of factors, like age, location, gender, religion, and more. These microtargeting capabilities have been used for years in a number of ways, including, most recently in the U.S. presidential election to reach niche audiences with political ads customized to their own interests. However, Facebook came under fire last fall because those same ad targeting capabilities were being used to include or exclude users from ad campaigns based on their “ethnic affinity,” –meaning race.

"On 4 February 2017, the British tabloid Mail on Sunday (and the Daily Mail's online site) published an article by David Rose — a longtime proponent of climate change conspiracy theories whose analyses the scientific community widely regards as flawed and deceptive — alleging that scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) used misleading data in order to rush publication of a groundbreaking climate study and thereby “dupe” world leaders:

The Mail on Sunday today reveals astonishing evidence that the organisation that is the world’s leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. A high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015. At issue is a June 2015 paper published in Science titled “‘Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus,” authored by (among others) Thomas R. Karl, director of the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. As described in an analysis accompanying the piece in Science, the paper dealt with an issue that deniers of anthropogenic climate change have rallied behind for years — that there has been a slowdown or “hiatus” in global warming since 1998 despite continually rising CO2 levels:

Previous analyses of global temperature trends during the first decade of the 21st century seemed to indicate that warming had stalled. This allowed critics of the idea of global warming to claim that concern about climate change was misplaced."	False

The Internet Movie Database — IMDb, for short — announced last week in a statement that it will be disabling its message boards on Feb. 20. “After in-depth discussion and examination,” the statement read, “we have concluded that IMDb’s message boards are no longer providing a positive, useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250 million monthly users worldwide.”

It will be an ignominious end for the site’s user forums, which were first launched in 1990 — making it positively ancient by internet standards. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its first entry was a list of beautiful women compiled by a man, Col Needham, who would go on to develop the underlying code that powered IMDb in its earliest days. It then grew into the premier user-generated database of information and discussion about movies and TV shows; the site was eventually purchased by Amazon in 1998, and a few years later it launched a subscription product aimed at people in “the business.”

Still, the user-generated content and the message boards, which were linked to every entry in the database, hung on through today. Though they were hit or miss at best, they could result in discussions about long-lost cinematic errata and continuity issues."	False

On this episode, I talk with Eleanor Blayney about the challenges of growing an independent RIA as a woman in a male-dominated industry, starting with how she first learned of the world of financial advice by reading about it in MONEY and Washingtonian magazines, and then cold called well-known advisors in the DC area until she found her way to her first job… and followed a path that ultimately led to her to becoming a partner at the firm despite not bringing her own book of clients. From there, Eleanor talks about how SBSB grew its first billion of AUM so rapidly, by providing a combination of financial planning, investment management, and tax preparation services and forming a niche specialization advising on stock options for tech companies during the 1990s tech boom, and what it was like to sell the firm and transition into her current role as an author and industry advocate.

And while the framework itself may be a rigorous way to look at a wide range of potential outcomes, there’s one big problem: it’s difficult to know how to interpret the results, and what to do with a scenario like a “95% probability of success”. Who wants to risk being part of the other 5%? In this guest post, Derek Tharp – our new Research Associate at Kitces.com, and a Ph.D. candidate in the financial planning program at Kansas State University – delves into behavioral biases and challenges that influence our ability to interpret the results of a Monte Carlo analysis, and in particular the so-called “wrong-side-of-maybe” fallacy. The wrong side of maybe fallacy refers to our tendency to interpret a projection as “wrong” if the outcome is inconsistent with the most likely outcome forecasted, and can quickly interfere with the proper interpretation and understanding of probabilistic forecasts.

To appease investors wary of taking on credit risk in a still uncertain market, Blackboard Inc BBBB.O and Telx Group last week lifted the coupons on their respective buyout loans but also offered the loans at unusually high discounts. Typically, banks, which earn a 2-3 percent fee based on the size of a loan, sell a loan at a wide discount only after they have exhausted their ability to increase the spread on it. Blackboard, the education software maker which is being bought for $1.64 billion by Providence Equity Partners, lifted the coupon on its $780 million first-lien term loan by 50 basis points to 600 basis points over Libor.

After eight years of vetoing U.N. resolutions condemning the terrorist State of Israel for their acts of military aggression (killing over 500 Palestinian children and 234 women in the last attack on the Gaza Strip) and the illegal occupation of Palestinian land, the Obama Administration finally did the right thing by not vetoing a U.N. resolution condemning Israel for settlements on Palestinian territory. Racist right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and neo-fascist racist Donald Trump both teamed up to condemn the Obama Administration for abstaining and not vetoing the resolution. Trump and Netanyahu found a supporter in local Brooklyn Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. In an embarrassing, disgraceful, shameful interview on NY1, Congressman Jeffries stated that Israel was “our closest ally” and the Obama Administration should have vetoed the resolution.

OdinText, the text analytics software company, today announced it found a slight majority of Americans (42 percent vs. 39 percent) disagree with President Trump’s controversial executive order that temporarily bars refugees and people from seven predominately-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The online study, conducted from Thursday, Feb. 2 to Sunday, Feb. 5, used a random, nationally-representative population sample, but differs from conventional polling methodology in that respondents were required to submit replies in a comment box in their own words, instead of selecting from an “agree/disagree” ratings scale. Text responses were then analyzed and quantified using the OdinText platform, which relies on natural language processing—the same technology corporations and market researchers use to understand consumer opinion and preferences on Twitter and other social media. “Emotions run high for people on both sides of this issue,” said OdinText Founder and Managing Partner Tom H.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — According to the Al Masdar media outlet, early on Saturday, Russian jets launched airstrikes against Daesh positions at the oil and gas rich towns of As Sukhnah and Arak northeast of Palmyra, destroying several supply vehicles headed to Raqqa. The Russian Defense Ministry has not yet commented on the reports. Earlier in December, the Syrian government forces had to retreat from Palmyra after Daesh launched a large-scale offensive. Daesh has been able to seize large territories in both Syria and Iraq since 2014 and used the oil fields in the captured areas to smuggle petroleum."	False

The real reason for Obama’s last-ditch sanctions is to align the EU-NATO Axis with dissident Republicans against President Trump for a final showdown. And this is how it just might play out. Russia’s wise move not to expel American diplomats widens President Trump’s room for maneuver in the New Year in response to the outgoing Obama administration’s scorched earth tactics. And yet, overall, the 45th President of the United States, once he is inaugurated on Jan 20 will have to fight tooth and nail against what has now become an insidious political insurgency against the will of the American people. Quite simply, the crux of the problem is not just the arrogance of the liberal elite whose platitudinous rhetoric failed to put Hilary in the Whitehouse: it’s the symbiotic relationship between Washington’s political oligarchy and its foreign conspirators in Brussels.

Any changes to the $500 billion-plus program hold enormous consequences not only for recipients but also for the states, which share in the cost. Trump initially said during the presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, but later expressed support for an idea pushed for years by Republicans in Congress — sending a fixed amount of money each year to the states in the form of block grants. Backers say such a change in the Medicaid formula is one of the best ways to rein in spending, but critics say big cuts would follow. Currently, the federal government pays an agreed-upon percentage of each state’s Medicaid costs, no matter how much they rise in any given year.	False

| MUMBAI/BENGALURU

MUMBAI/BENGALURU Wipro, India's third-largest software services exporter, forecast muted revenue growth for its third quarter as clients in its biggest market, the United States, await clarity on business policies under the Donald Trump administration.India's $150 billion information technology (IT) industry struggled through most of 2016 as western clients delayed spending ahead of the U.S. presidential election and after Britain's shock move to leave the European Union.Clients are likely to remain uncertain about discretionary technology spending until the Trump administration takes key policy decisions on tax, healthcare and trade, Wipro's chief financial officer, Jatin Dalal, told Reuters on Wednesday. ""Whether there is a pick-up in decision-making because the elections are behind, the answer is no, because clearly people don't see it as a continuation of the earlier administration,"" Dalal said.Wipro expects revenue from its IT services business to be in the range of $1.92 billion to $1.94 million, the company said.The company's IT services revenue grew to $1.9 billion in the quarter to Dec. 31, up 3.5 percent year on year.Wipro has acquired four businesses, including cloud services company Appirio, in the past two years, but analysts expect revenue growth to remain muted. ""Despite its acquisitions, Wipro's revenue growth lags the industry's and we believe it is likely to remain in the mid-single digits over FY17-19 due to a faster than expected deceleration in its legacy services revenue,"" UBS said in a research note this month.Indian IT revenues are likely to increase by a slower than expected 8 percent to 10 percent in constant currency terms in the year to March 31, a local lobby group said late last year.The prospect of higher costs also looms as IT companies, which fly engineers to the U.S. to service clients, may have to have to hire more local staff in a more protectionist technology visa programme expected under Trump. ""Across the United States and many other geographies, such as the UK, Singapore and South Africa, we have been aggressively localising,"" Wipro Chief Executive Abidali Neemuchwala said. ""There may be certain cost implications, but in the past we have been able to absorb the increase in visa fees."	False

Google released its annual “bad ads” report on Wednesday, stating that it kicked nearly 200 publishers off its AdSense network for misleading content. The move was part of Google’s investigation into 550 sites during November and December that were suspected of dishing out bogus diplomas, serving up fake news, and more questionable content. Google updated its AdSense misrepresentation content policy in November to take action against these deceiving AdSense members. Google’s AdSense platform is a service for website publishers who want to place advertisements (text, image, or video) on their pages that target their audience.	False

It’s confounding to witness, but Donald Trump managed to do both over the last two days. The president kicked off Tuesday by meeting with the heads of Detroit's Big Three automakers, a sector he regularly blasted on the trail for underinvesting in the United States. In full Apprentice mode with news cameras rolling, Trump challenged the CEOs to add more jobs and capacity at home in return for lighter tax and regulatory burdens. After the meeting, the three executives heaped praise on Trump, with Ford chief Mark Fields talking up the president's ""courage"" for walking away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and heralding a new era of cooperation between the industry and government that could spawn a ""renaissance in American manufacturing."""

Just as an addition to both the PlayStation VR talk and the Project Scorpio comments today, it’s been noticed that the official Project Scorpio website has removed a reference to ‘high fidelity VR’ from its list of features. Now this could just be an oversight, or maybe they felt it was giving too much away, but the most obvious explanation is that Microsoft has cooled on the idea of VR and at the very least isn’t intending to launch it at the same time as Scorpio itself. I remember stories before the PlayStation VR launch that PC headset sales had hit a wall, and in the last few days we’ve had a lot of uncertainty over whether Sony’s one is sold out or just purposefully low stock because they only expect it to be a niche appeal. I’m sure Resident Evil 7 in VR is as good as everyone says it is but again you’ve got to wonder whether we’re not all getting carried away here. We, as hardcore gamers, may think VR is great and worth it but that doesn’t mean the vast majority of other punters think the same way.	False

Germany is expected to shortly decide to launch a competition to replace its ageing short-range air-defenses, for which Kongsberg’s NASAMS and Diehl’s surface-launch variant of the IRIS-T air-to-air missile (pictured) are said to be favored. (Diehl photo)

BERLIN --- Germany is nearing a decision to replace its aging short-range air defense systems and help fill a gap that has caused concern among NATO members after Russia's annexation of Crimea, two sources familiar with the issue said.A decision to move ahead would pave the way for a procurement program valued at 460 million euros through the middle of the next decade, with 2 billion euros in further spending likely in a later phase, said one of the sources. New lasers and radars could be added later at additional cost.A spokesman said the Defence Ministry had taken an initial look at the issue but had not yet made a decision about how to proceed.One of the sources said officials had a favorable view of a system developed for Sweden by Diehl Defense, a privately held German weapons maker, which includes a variant of its IRIS-T missile and a dual-cab tracked vehicle built by Hagglunds Vehicle AB, a unit of BAE Systems.Diehl's IRIS-T missile, used by Germany for its Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, could be adapted for ground-based launch with a software change. The company also builds a longer-range IRIS-T SLS for Sweden's program designed for surface-to-air use.A spokesman for Diehl declined to comment on the expected decision. Diehl submitted a separate proposal to build a missile for a medium-range air and missile defense system that the German government is evaluating.Once the decision is finalised, the Defence Ministry will map out its functional requirements, to be completed in May, the source said."

Fulfilling one of his campaign promises, President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to start construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. During his campaign, Trump promised he'd get Mexico to foot the bill, saying in April of last year that the United States' neighbor to the south could make a ""one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year."" But last July, research group Bernstein estimated a different figure, and it's a lot more than the President predicted. Minus labor and land acquisition costs, analysts there found that the materials needed to build a 40-foot-tall, 7-foot-deep, 10-inch-thick, and 1,000-mile-long wall between the U.S. and Mexico would cost $15 billion.

The first initiative for a summer democracy festival on a remote Baltic island dates back to legendary Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. Fifty years and a social media revolution later, assembly democracy is great again – at least for a few days in summer across Scandinavia. These days, it may take hours for the short walk across the medieval town of Visby on the island of Gotland in the middle of the Baltic Sea.

President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner said in a statement to congressional committees on Monday that he ""did not collude"" with Russia or seek back channels with Moscow last year. ""I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,"" Kushner said in a written statement released before his appearance in closed-door meetings with members of the U.S. Congress.

LONDON — Music streaming company Spotify is close to agreeing a new licensing pact with Warner Music Inc, the last big music royalty deal it needs before pushing ahead with a U.S. stock market listing, four sources familiar with the situation said. The parties are positive a deal could be signed by September as major issues such as granting loss-making Spotify a more favourable revenue split in return for making some new albums accessible only to its paying subscribers for a defined period have already been agreed, the sources said.

The postwar reconstruction of Syria is an attractive project for Chinese firms, which would like to see a stable Syria play a key role in the ""One Belt, One Road"" economic initiative.The eagerness of Chinese companies to get involved in projects to reconstruct war-torn Syria was plain to see at the Syria Day Expo in Beijing earlier this month, which was attended by hundreds of Chinese specialists in infrastructure investment.The Expo will be followed by several similar events in China, including a Syria Reconstruction Expo, Pepe Escobar reported in Asia Times.Dmitri Abzalov, President of the Center of Strategic Communications, told RIA Novosti that Chinese companies are keen for the Syrian government to award them contracts for reconstruction projects. ""Syria itself may not have money, but if there is a lasting peace then an international conference will be held and funds for rebuilding the infrastructure will be allocated,"" Abzalov said, adding that Chinese companies are keen to plan in advance for such an eventuality.In addition, Chinese energy companies may be interested in the development of the country's oil and gas reserves, most of which are located in the eastern province of Deir-ex-Zor.Before the Syrian conflict began in 2011, the Syrian government's main energy contracts were with Western energy companies such as Shell and Total, but Chinese energy firms are keen to get a bigger share of the market.In contrast to the US, which sees formal military relations as crucial to relationships with its allies, China is more interested in building economic relationships . Abzalov said that China is not seeking a military presence in the Middle East, but wants to expand economic ties there.Such an arrangement would appear to suit the Syrian government. Earlier this month, the Syrian Ambassador to China Imad Moustapha confirmed that China, Russia and Iran will have priority over other participants in implementing economic initiatives and projects in Syria.Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told Sputnik that the restoration of Syrian infrastructure must be the post-war priority.

For many decades, educators have viewed algebra as something students need to understand in high school, if not earlier.

The Filioque

Indissolubility of Marriage

Purgatory, the Immaculate Conception, and other disagreements

Eastern and Western Christianity have been divided for a millennium, and although in recent decades both Catholic and Orthodox leaders have made closer ties a priority, some serious issues still remain -- including, in the first place, the role and the authority of the pope.With the Eastern Orthodox wrapping up their ""Holy and Great Council"" this past weekend, designed to be a ""pan-Orthodox"" event even though four churches, including the Russian Orthodox, pulled out, it might be a good time to take a look at the factors that separate Catholics from their sister Churches in the east.The main issues of disagreement are the primacy of the Bishop of Rome and elements of Trinitarian teaching, although conflict also exists over the Immaculate Conception, purgatory and other doctrines.For 1,000 years, the Churches of east and west were in communion with one another, holding seven ecumenical councils between 325 and 787 to define Christian belief.But over time, the cultures of the Latin-speaking west and Greek-speaking east grew more and more estranged, and there was increasing distrust and hostility between them. Occasional schisms occurred but were healed - such as the Acacian schism of the late fifth century and the Photian schism of the 860s.After 1009, the Bishop of Rome did not appear in the diptychs - the list of bishops in communion with the local Church - of Constantinople, traditionally considered ""first among equals"" in the Orthodox world.In 1054, a papal delegation to the Patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated the patriarch and were in turn excommunicated by him. Though this schism was as much an issue of personal animosity and misunderstanding as anything else, the schism was never healed as the earlier schisms had been.At least as important as the Schism of 1054 was the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Crusaders from the West, who were supposed to have continued on to Jerusalem to release it from Muslim control, instead spent three days looting and vandalizing the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The sack cemented eastern distrust of and resentment toward the west, preventing any healing of the schism.The foremost theological-ecclesiological division between Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism is the role of the Bishop of Rome, or the Pope."

Tzipi Livni, former Israeli Foreign Minister, has said she fears the country is on the verge of a religious battle with the Muslim world. Her comments follow days of violent clashes after security forces imposed controversial security measures at a disputed shrine in Jerusalem.Metal detectors were imposed at the shrine - known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount - in response to an attack on the site by Palestinian gunmen that killed two policemen.Tensions have been high ever since, with Muslim leaders - who claim the enhanced security measures are driven by Israel's desire to expand its control over the area - calling for mass protests at noon prayers, Friday, July 21.In response, authorities banned Muslim men under the age of 50 from entering Jerusalem's Old City, where the shrine is located.Over the ensuing weekend, there were violent clashes between Muslims and state security forces, with three Palestinians killed, and a 20-year-old Palestinian stabbing and killing three members of an Israeli family in their home in a West Bank settlement.Jason Greenblatt, US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, has reportedly been dispatched to Tel Aviv to attempt to defuse the growing crisis, marking the Trump administration's first direct foray into the crisis.First, Israel's war of ""independence"" began in 1947, at the end of the British Mandate of Palestine - it pitted Jewish militias against Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, and concluded with the state's creation.For almost 20 years subsequently, the Israel Defense Forces fought a guerrilla war against Arab insurgents hailing from Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, culminating in the ""Six Day War"" in 1967, a fully-fledged conflict with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, and troops from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Algeria.Following the war, Israel expanded its territory significantly, seizing the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, Golan Heights from Syria, Sinai and Gaza from Egypt.It retains much of this territory in the modern day, despite the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, waged by Israel against a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria, which collectively (and unsuccessfully) aimed to recapture the ground lost six years prior."

""Results revealed that mathematically capable individuals who also had high verbal skills were less likely to pursue STEM careers than were individuals who had high math skills but moderate verbal skills. One notable finding was that the group with high math and high verbal ability included more females than males...



Our study provides evidence that it is not lack of ability that causes females to pursue non-STEM careers, but rather the greater likelihood that females with high math ability also have high verbal ability and thus can consider a wider range of occupations than their male peers with high math ability, who are more likely to have moderate verbal ability.""

Four Australians who were found guilty of vandalism for removing a brass sword from a war memorial told a court that their actions were inspired by Pope Francis, referencing a message in which the pontiff said that religion cannot be used to justify war.The men were convicted on Monday of vandalizing the memorial - which consists of a stone crucifix and a brass ""sword of sacrifice"" - in Brisbane's Toowong cemetery on Ash Wednesday, March 1.One of the defendants, 61-year-old James Joseph Dowling, told the Brisbane magistrates court ahead of the Monday ruling that Pope Francis had ""influenced"" them to remove the sword from the monument. ""We were influenced by Pope Francis's words...where he said religion can never be used to justify war, and peace alone is holy,"" Dowling said, as quoted by the Australian Associated Press. ""To actually go as far as to remove Jesus from the cross and replace it with a sword was the ultimate desecration of this symbol of our faith.

""It's a drug that had been withdrawn from the market because it lost its potency as an antibiotic, but we know it can be administered to humans,"" said Jose Pedro Cerón, a member of the research team, reported RTVE The antibiotic in question had been previously prescribed to fend off infections acquired inside a hospital.The molecular structure of proteins involved in the Zika virus' replication process was first discovered only a year ago.Now, the 'novobiocin' compound has been tested on mice achieving a 100 percent cure rate. Researchers still need to establish the appropriate dose to administer to humans to acquire the same response.Experiments carried out by the University of Hong Kong support the findings from the Spanish researchers. Both universities have now patented the molecule as an anti-Zika treatment.Cerón hopes the research will lead to the re-commercialization of the novobiocin drug.Zika is spread mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito and presents particularly high risks to pregnant women.In early 2015 the virus rapidly escalated throughout South America and the Caribbean leading the World Health Organisation to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.WHO announced the end of the Zika epidemic in November 2016."

The announcement came on the same day with Sigma’s new restructuring of its lens lineup, with three new categories that would differentiate different types of lenses: “Contemporary” for small and lightweight consumer lenses, “Art” for professional zoom and prime lenses and “Sports” for long lenses targeted at sport and wildlife photography. Being a professional-level lens targeted at a variety of photography needs, including portraiture, landscapes and travel, the 35mm f/1.4 is the first Sigma lens that falls into the “Art” category. Thanks to its large aperture of f/1.4, the lens is not only great for low-light photography, but it also can effectively isolate subjects from the background due to shallow depth of field, beautifully rendering background highlights, also known as “bokeh“. Unlike cheaper cropped-sensor lenses, the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 is designed to work on both APS-C / DX and full-frame / FX sensors.	False

The bill has already been submitted to parliamentary legal bodies. The document was drafted by MPs from the centrist factions without any direct links to Viktor Yanukovich or Viktor Yushchenko, who are seen as the key candidates for the presidency. Ukrainian experts agree that the bill shows that the two major political forces led by Yanukovich and Yushchenko want to remove incumbent President Leonid Kuchma so that he cannot stand for the post again, although the Constitution Court has ruled that he can do just that. According to experts, the fact that the law was drafted by observers rather than participants in the fight between Yanukovich and Yushchenko points to a kind of peace agreement between the authorities and the opposition forces.

The program, called OpenSSH (Secure Shell), is installed on tens of millions of servers made by vendors such as Red Hat, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM. It is used by administrators to make encrypted connections with other computers and do tasks such as remotely updating files. OpenSSH is the open-source version, and there are commercial versions of the program. Earlier this week, SANS received an anonymous e-mail claiming of a zero-day vulnerability in OpenSSH, which means a flaw in the software is already being exploited as it becomes public.	False

Yet now they have to deal with potential blind spots between client and application and application and application communications within the virtual environment, says Charles Thompson, product manager at Network Instruments. ""We hear from network managers all the time about how they have to be very focused on what is running across their network because often they are expected to be able to point to the cause of the performance problem even if it is not on the network,"" he says."

Twenty camels bound from southeast Russia to a circus in Bulgaria were stuck and became starved and dehydrated on the border between Moldova and Romania earlier this week, a popular Russian daily said. Komsomolskaya Pravda said the animals, who can theoretically last a month without food and two weeks without liquid, passed the Russian, Ukrainian, and Moldovan customs without a hitch and then problems began in Romania’s Albita. “We paid for the completion of the documents but they did not let us bring the camels into the country, they even banned us from giving them food and water!” said Lachezar Stefanov of the Bulgarian circus agency. The double-humped camels from Russia’s Kalmykia region ended up in a long-haul truck for 17 days until November 15 when they were sheltered by sympathetic zoo workers of Chisinau, the capital of Moldova.

A newly unearthed bug in certain versions of the PHP scripting language could crash servers when the software is given the task of converting a large floating point number, raising the possibility that the glitch could be exploited by hackers. The bug will cause the PHP processing software to enter an infinite loop when it tries to convert the series of digits ""2.2250738585072011e-308"" from the string format into the floating point format. At least one PHP user has commented that a malicious user could crash a server running PHP by feeding this digit to the PHP processor through the language's get function. The bug only seems to affect version 5.2 and 5.3 of the language, and only when they are run on Intel 32-bit CPUs that use the x87 instruction set. To fix the problem, users can download patches for those versions or recompile PHP with additional flags for handling floating point digits."	False

DHCP is a mechanism by which IP addresses can be assigned to devices, eliminating the need (in many cases) for static IP addresses. In fact, we’ve suggested in prior newsletters (including the Oct. 10 newsletter) that a good check on whether a resource is available is to try to address the resource directly via an IP address.

Software vendors and many enterprises have teams of engineers in house to perform this testing, or rely on third parties such as the panelists’ companies that specialize in finding vulnerabilities.

Bourdillon recalled that while global oil prices are currently at their lowest level in twelve years, petrol prices increased by 50 percent in Saudi Arabia late last year due to a government decision to cut subsidies. ""Ryadh had no choice. Its treasury is quickly becomes empty because of the falling price of oil, which provides Saudi Arabia with almost all its budgetary resources,"" Bourdillon said.

TEHRAN, September 1 (RIA Novosti) – The first-ever female spokesperson for the Islamic republic’s foreign ministry proclaimed in her inauguration speech on Sunday that Iran was opposed to any military intervention by a Western nation in the Syrian civil war. Marzieh Afkham, who served the ministry for nearly 30 years before being appointed official spokeswoman on Thursday, called for the parties in the Syrian conflict to engage in dialogue to find a political solution and said Iran did “not intend to make any hasty judgments about the current situation.”

“We have stated numerous times that we oppose any kind of [military invention] in the region because it could entail serious repercussions; the region is volatile enough. Such [intervention] could lead to a new crisis,” Afkham said at the ceremony in Tehran. US President Barack Obama said Saturday that his country was considering an attack on Syria that would be “limited in duration and scope.”

A day before, the United States released a report saying that Syria’s government was responsible for a chemical attack that purportedly killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb late last month, an alleged violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 on refraining from the use of such weapons."

In a statement from the White House Rose Garden, Obama said he had decided that the United States should take military action against targets in Syria, reiterating US assertions that the government of President Bashar Assad was to blame for the apparent use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war. But Obama went on to say that the decision was too important for any president to take alone and required a national debate in order for the will of the American people to be heard through the legislative branch of government. “Our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people and for the people,” Obama said.

Over the years, I’ve had a chance to both observe the behaviour of summer hires at many of Canada’s largest employers, and more recently to hire and manage summer students. While many students make the most of these career-building opportunities, others fail to take advantage – or worse, damage their reputations – through inappropriate behaviour. If you are a student embarking on or in the midst of a summer assignment, here are the top three mistakes students make in their summer jobs and suggestions for what to do instead. Mistake No.	False

Uber played down the non-binding opinion from an advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), saying it applied only to a service using unlicensed drivers known as UberPOP which it had already discontinued in France. Judges will make a final ruling later this year. However, they generally follow the advice of their advocates general and the comments come two months after another opinion, which rejected Uber’s argument that it was only a digital platform and so subject to less regulation than a transport firm. The European court battles are being fought as Uber struggles with last month’s departure of its co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick following a string of scandals that have battered one of the global stars of the U.S. tech industry.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) said he wants to make clear that the nation’s third-largest school system is not just responsible for shepherding teenagers to the end of their senior year, but also for setting them on a path to a productive future. “We are going to help kids have a plan, because they’re going to need it to succeed,” he said. “You cannot have kids think that 12th grade is done.”

Few would dispute that kids often need more than a high school diploma to thrive in today’s economy, but there is a simmering debate about the extent to which schools should be — and realistically can be — expected to ensure their graduates receive further training."	False

Mobile telecommunications services in Latvia, a small republic on the frontier between the European Union and the old Soviet Union, may already have been the target of a cyber attack in August 2017. Now Latvijas Mobilais Telefons (LMT), the country's largest mobile operator, is inviting would-be belligerents to test their cyber weapons on its network -- or rather, on a simulation of it, called the Mobile Cyber Range. The range was used by NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence as part of Exercise Crossed Swords in February 2018. Crossed Swords is the training ground for the ""red team"" that simulates attacks on NATO cyber infrastructure in another NATO exercise, Locked Shields. Like a traditional shooting range, LMT's Mobile Cyber Range is a place to test-fire weapons, in this case malware intended to interfere with carriers' wireless networks or the mobile devices that connect to them, without anyone in the real world getting hurt, according to Armands Meirans, a B2B Solutions Manager at LMT."

Smaller than either full-frame or APS-C, Micro Four Thirds sensors allowed the company to design a diminutive camera system that paired to equally small lenses. The advantages of such a compact interchangeable-lens camera system helped define the mirrorless market and usher in a new era of photography. While the size of the Micro Four Thirds sensor favors a more compact camera build, there are some tradeoffs to contend with when it comes to lens optics. Generally, it is more difficult to create wide-angle lenses for Micro Four Thirds, as the small sensor has a doubling of equivalent focal length, relative to DSLRs.	False

Seeking to press President Donald Trump to clamp down on Russia, the U.S. Congress voted nearly unanimously last year to pass a law setting sweeping new sanctions on Moscow. Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress, signed it reluctantly in August, just six months into his presidency.

Smaller than either full-frame or APS-C, Micro Four Thirds sensors allowed the company to design a diminutive camera system that paired to equally small lenses. The advantages of such a compact interchangeable-lens camera system helped define the mirrorless market and usher in a new era of photography. While the size of the Micro Four Thirds sensor favors a more compact camera build, there are some tradeoffs to contend with when it comes to lens optics. Generally, it is more difficult to create wide-angle lenses for Micro Four Thirds, as the small sensor has a doubling of equivalent focal length, relative to DSLRs.	False

Other companies, such as Waterton Associates, a Chicago-based real estate investment and property management company, take a more people-oriented approach to DX by establishing an innovation lab that fosters companywide creativity and collaboration.

The deep brain stimulation (DBS) implant resembles cardiac pacemaker devices, except the wires are implanted in the brain instead of the heart. The brain pacemaker transmits electrical impulses through electrodes to regulate abnormal impulses in areas of the brain that control movement. Many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, are caused by disrupted communication among neurons that results in the case of Alzheimer's in loss of function and cell death. After surgeons implant an electrode inside the brain, a small neurostimulator is placed in the chest or abdomen.	False

The British think-tank UK in a Changing EU on January 31 published a report detailing new social and political divisions emerging in Britain as a result of the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union. Unusually, the report examined questions of religious identity and found that those self-identifying as Anglican were by far the most likely faith community to vote in favor of Brexit, due to the Anglican Church being inextricably linked to the monarchy and Britain's national identity. The authors also suggested the influence of historical anti-Catholic animosity as being partly responsible for the result, despite Catholics also being more likely to back the Leave campaign than Remain. Those with no religious affiliation were the most liable to support remaining in the European Union.	False

HONOLULU -- Hawaii emergency management officials knew for years that an employee had problems performing his job. Then, he sent a false alert warning of an imminent missile attack earlier this month. The worker had mistakenly believed drills for tsunami and fire warnings were actual events, and colleagues were not comfortable working with him, the state said Tuesday.

The new report explains that the issue was not just a missed click, but several things:

The test was meant to take place during the morning shift change, in order to be more confusing and keep workers on their toes. The morning supervisor thought that the outgoing evening supervisor meant to test the evening crew just getting off, not the day crew just coming on — so he wasn’t in the right place to keep an eye on the latter."

Under the settlement that must be approved by a U.S. judge, owners of 3.0 litre vehicles who opt for fixes will get compensation of between $7,000 and $16,000 from Volkswagen if emissions fixes are approved in a timely fashion – and the auto maker will pay another $500 if the fix affects a vehicle’s performance. Owners who opt for a buyback will get $7,500 on top of the value of the vehicle.	False

The rise of right-wing populism across Europe can be attributed to economic motives rather than racial prejudice and the dislike of foreigners, which mainstream media often claim, a survey by Norwegian researcher Ole-Petter Moe Hansen from Norwegian School of Economics and his Swiss colleague Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen found. In their research ""Trading off Welfare and Immigration in Europe,"" which uses data from the European Social Survey on sixteen countries from 2002-2012, Moe Hansen and Legge attributed the spike in populist parties' popularity to rising unemployment amid the growing percentage of immigrants. At the same time, the percentage of disenchanted voters who support redistribution policies and are in favor of welfare state, yet oppose migration is also rising. According to the researchers, the increase is particularly significant among voters with low education who tend to be the most vulnerable in the labor market.

In addition to the need for greater transparency, another key criteria in evaluating service automation solutions for Tavistock was the ability to achieve consistency in its FM operations, an important consideration for a rapidly growing organization comprised of 17 upscale and unique restaurant brands with locations throughout the country including Abe & Louie's, AquaKnox, Atlas, Canvas Restaurant & Market, Napa Valley Grille, California Cafe, Atlantic Fish Co., Coach Grill, ZED451, Joe's American Bar & Grill, Top Catch at Joe's Waterfront, Blackhawk Grille, Timpano, Cafe del Rey, Canonita, Sapporo and the soon-to-open Chroma Modern Bar + Kitchen. ""Procedural inconsistency for facility operations at our locations was an issue,"" said Eric Rainville, Director of Facilities at Tavistock Restaurant Collection. ""It was a real challenge to manage such a diverse and highly distributed portfolio with different products, equipment and processes at each location."" In addition to the inconsistency in operations, Tavistock struggled with the ad-hoc nature of managing repair and maintenance work orders."	False

What's changed with the Eero since its release is the fact that after numerous software updates, many of which derived from data Eero has gleaned from its customers' real-world usage in the past year, the system is now slightly faster through a new approach to mesh networking Eero's company calls TrueMesh.

Part of the problem is that the malaria parasite is a shape-shifter, making it hard to target. But another part of the problem is that even the parasite's proteins, which could be used as vaccines, are unstable at tropical temperatures and require complicated, expensive cellular systems to produce them in large quantities. Unfortunately, the vaccines are most needed in areas where refrigeration is lacking and funds to buy vaccines are scarce. However, a new approach developed at the Weizmann Institute of Science, recently reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), could, in the future, lead to an inexpensive malaria vaccine that can be stored at room temperature.

The grandson of legendary Egyptian actors Omar Sharif and Faten Hamama, who was forced to leave his native Egypt for the US when he came out as gay in 2012, has voiced his dismay at the ban on citizens travelling from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as all refugees currently seeking settlement in the US. Speaking exclusively to Attitude, the 33-year-old described the ban, which is already being challenged in the US federal court system, as “highly distressing – in particular for those seeking refuge from discrimination, hatred and warfare.”

He continued: “While physically, many might not make it to safety after years of patiently waiting; psychologically, hopes will be crushed and a sense of humanity will be lost. “More often than not, when refugees flee it’s not with with their heads down in despair, but with their eyes looking upward for inspiration – not only to the stars, but to the Stars and Stripes. “The US has always represented that beacon of light and freedom, of liberty and justice for all."

Piane was roundly condemned at the time, including by several Drag Race alumnae, but now the musician has apologised for his actions, blaming his behaviour on a long-lasting psychosis induced by eating too much marijuana, which he claims he was using to treat an undiagnosed medical issue that had left him bed-ridden. “Id like to extend an apology to anyone who might have been offended by what I said during my “marijuana psychosis” (according to UCLA doctors) over the past few months,” he wrote on Instagram on Tuesday (January 31).

The upshot of virtualization of servers was that far greater efficiencies could be generated, and utilization rates went from being dismal to almost absolute.
