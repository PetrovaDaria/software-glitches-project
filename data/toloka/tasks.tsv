Mark Wilson insists money won’t be the deciding factor in an Old Firm derby which will only serve to highlight the failure of Rangers to develop any long-term strategy. The former Celtic full-back believes his old club will shatter the myth that a superior bank balance has increased the gulf between their ancient rivals and it’s a neglect in youth development which will come back to haunt a Light Blues side with little legacy. Kieran Tierney , Callum McGregor and James Forrest will be almost certain starters for the Hoops this lunchtime with 18-year-old Michael Johnston on the bench. The likes of Anthony Ralston, Calvin Miller and Jack Aitchison have all sampled first team action this year which is a far cry from the Ibrox side who have Danny Wilson, Ross McCrorie Jamie Barjonas and Ryan Hardrie to claim as home grown."

We call them school ""systems"" for a reason. And it takes no genius to conclude that our nation's schools are failing us miserably at several levels. Teachers enter their vocation to teach; however, the demands of the system leave precious little time for developing students' intellects. Instead, the system calls upon educators to be social workers; psychologists; life coaches; and, more recently, armed combatants. Perhaps it is high time to rethink the school system in light of cascading failures."	True

Major firms including Vanguard Group, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD.O) and Fidelity Investments reported service slowdowns on their websites amid heightened demand from clients. For many firms an issue was the growing adoption of financial apps on mobile devices, which make it much easier for clients to check their balances or watch market indexes. That created greater network loads, even when clients were not looking to trade. “The app is in their hands and they can check it as they get out of the car.	True

TORONTO -- Traders using at least two major online discount brokerage platforms are complaining of sporadic outages and expressing frustration that the latest glitch has tied their hands amidst a broad plunge in marijuana stocks. Clients of TD Bank's WebBroker and Royal Bank's RBC Direct Investing platforms have again taken to social media to gripe about problems, after facing similar issues in recent days. A TD spokesman says ""unprecedented"" trading volume continues to drive some intermittent delays for its online and mobile WebBroker clients, and the bank's technical teams are continuing to work to resolve the issue. Brandon Colwell, an economics student and WebBroker user, says he has lost at least $8,000 today and the outages on Dec. 29 and on Jan. 2 appear to be coinciding with surges in trading activity in the cannabis sector. Several marijuana companies took a major hit today -- with shares of Canada's biggest licensed producer Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED) down as much as 19 per cent -- after the Associated Press reported U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions planned to rescind an Obama-era policy that allowed legalized pot to flourish in states south of the border."

The Bank admitted on Thursday evening that its IT system was suffering “intermittent technology communication problems” following a “regular internal update”. The problem impaired the central bank’s ability to process a limited number of transactions for wholesale counterparties, leading it to implement “workarounds” to enable the Bank to operate as normal. However, on Friday morning, the Bank said that the issue had been fixed overnight, but said that wholesale counterparty transactions may be delayed as it plays catch up. A statement read: “Technology communications problems reported by the Bank yesterday have been fixed overnight.	True

On Friday, the VN Index hit its highest since May 2007 and neared the record set in March that year. It climbed more than 1 percent on Thursday and Friday, the first days after the shutdown, and had a weekly gain of 5.04 percent - its biggest since the week ended July 3, 2015. The technical glitch, which halted trading minutes before Monday’s scheduled closing, illustrated the kinds of risks that investors in new or fast-growing markets can face. Last year, Vietnam was among the world’s fastest rising markets, with the benchmark leaping nearly 50 percent.	True
